# Weighted Correlation Atom Decomposition 
October 2015

WCAD is an intonation modeling algorithm based on using the weighted correlation as a cost function in the matching pursuit framework. 

To run WCAD, clone it from `git` and start `wcad.py`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dipteam/wcad.git
cd wcad
./wcad.py path-to-audio/my-wav.wav path-to-results/
```
To run WCAD you need a compiled binary for the pitch tracker `compute-kaldi-pitch-feats` from [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org/). WCAD uses it to get a continuous pitch estimate and a probability of voicing. Kaldi's code can be found [here](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi). Once compiled you need to add the path to the binary in the file `./paths.cfg`.

The code supports [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) TextGrid annotations for extracting the utterance boundaries and for plotting syllables/words/phones in the final plots. By default these should be in a folder called `annotations/` in the audio folder. This functionality is added with the inclusion of `textgrid.py` from the [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](https://github.com/nltk/nltk_contrib), which can be found [here](https://github.com/nltk/nltk_contrib/blob/master/nltk_contrib/textgrid.py).

The algorithm's parameters can be tweaked in the file `wcad/object_types/params.py`.

The Weighted Correlation Atom Decomposition algorithm is described in the paper:
